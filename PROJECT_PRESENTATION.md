# Project Name 

Connections Conundrum 

## Overview
The Trials of the Oracle

Captured in the heart of the ancient Kata Forests, you find yourself trapped in a dark, enigmatic chamber. 
The room is silent except for the voice of a mysterious oracle. It looms over you, demanding proof of 
your coding prowess. A fan of The New York Times' infamous games, the oracle is particularly fond of
challenges that tease the brain, like Wordle, Sudoku, and Connections. To escape, you must outsmart 
the oracle by conquering its three trials. Each trial reveals a fragment of the key to your freedom.

Trial 2: The Connections Conundrum

The Oracle reveals 4 mysterious words and challenges you to guess the link between them all. The connections between the words might be subtle, so you’ll need sharp reasoning and a keen eye for patterns. Inspired by the oracle’s love of Connections, this trial tests your ability to categorize and connect concepts.

Your task is to write a function that identifies the correct grouping and ensures your solution handles edge cases, for example capitals and white space. 


## Planning Phase

### Project Requirements
- Primary objectives and must-have features
MVP 1- user input accepted and compared with hard-coded connection answer.

- Secondary objectives and nice-to-have features
MVP 2- function which compares user input and answer is case insensitive. 
MVP 3- function which compares user input and answer is insensitive to white space before and after word. 
MVP 4- function that compares user input and answer and returns false with invalid input (non-letters).
MVP 5- function that throws error if user input is not a string. 


- Technical constraints and limitations
Due to userInput being text, errors may be made in spelling that can't be accounted for.
There are so many ways of phrasing things, the app would not be able to tell the user if their guess was close or not.


### Resources
- Required tools and technologies
-Vitest for unit testing

## Brainstorming

### Ideas & Concepts
MVP 1- user input and answer compared

MVP 2- case insensitivity

MVP 3- white space ignored

MVP 4- invalid input(non-letters) returns an error message to the user 'Invalid input

MVP 5 - Throw error if userInput isn't a string
